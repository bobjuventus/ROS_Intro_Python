# ROS_Intro_Python
Robot Ignite Academy ROS in 5 days_Python

This repo contains solutions to the Robot Ignite Academy ROS in 5 days_Python solutions.

Notes:
1. In 'unit3_services' package, notice currently 'call_bb8_move_in_square_service_server.launch' both execute and call the service. One can remove the   '(<include file="$(find unit3_services)/launch/start_bb8_move_in_square_service_server.launch"/>)'
to just call the service.
